# End-to-End Observability Implementation for Shopiet E-commerce Application using ADOT

This document provides a comprehensive guide to implement end-to-end observability for the Shopiet e-commerce application using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) with complete metrics, logs, and traces collection.

## Project Overview

The Shopiet application is a full-stack e-commerce platform with:
- **Backend**: Django REST API with PostgreSQL database and Redis for caching/WebSockets
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, using Axios for API calls
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose setup with multiple services

## Observability Architecture

We will implement a comprehensive observability solution that includes:

1. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Application metrics (Django/React performance)
   - Database metrics (PostgreSQL)
   - Cache metrics (Redis)
   - Infrastructure metrics (Docker containers)
   - Custom business metrics

2. **Logging**:
   - Application logs (Django/React)
   - Database logs
   - System logs
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs

3. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - End-to-end request tracing from frontend to backend
   - Database query tracing
   - Redis operation tracing
   - WebSocket connection tracing

## Components to be Modified/Added

### Backend (Django) Changes:
1. Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation
2. Configure ADOT for Django
3. Add custom metrics and logging
4. Instrument database and Redis operations

### Frontend (React) Changes:
1. Add OpenTelemetry Web SDK
2. Implement user interaction tracing
3. Add performance metrics collection

### Infrastructure Changes:
1. Add ADOT Collector service
2. Configure monitoring pipeline
3. Set up AWS services integration

### New Configuration Files:
1. ADOT Collector configuration
2. Instrumentation configuration
3. Logging configuration
4. Updated Docker Compose with observability

## Implementation Benefits

- **End-to-end visibility**: Track requests from frontend to backend services
- **Performance optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly  
- **Error monitoring**: Quick detection and resolution of issues
- **Business insights**: Track user behavior and application usage patterns
- **Scalability insights**: Understand resource utilization patterns

## Next Steps

The following files will provide the complete implementation:

1. Updated Django settings and requirements
2. OpenTelemetry instrumentation for Django
3. React OpenTelemetry setup
4. ADOT Collector configuration
5. Updated Docker Compose with observability services
6. Custom metrics and logging implementations
7. Dashboard configurations for visualization
